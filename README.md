# git-task

Install git and create folder name git-task and initialise it.

Add file named "first.txt" and commit as "First commit"

Add 1 more file "second.txt" and commit as "Second commit"

Create a branch named "ffbranch" and switch to it

Edit both files add some small changes and commit as, 

For first.txt "FF branch commit first.txt" 

For second.txt "FF branch commit second.txt"

Switch to master or main branch and merge FF branch to main.

Edit the merge message and save as "First Merge from FF branch to main"

Create another branch named "dvbranch" and switch to it.

Edit both files add some small changes and commit as, 

For first.txt "DV branch commit first.txt" 

For second.txt "DV branch commit second.txt"


Switch to master or main branch and edit any of the file and commit 

For first.txt "DV branch ready for conflict"

And now merge DV branch to main [conflict? solve it!]

Edit the merge message and save as "Second Merge almost killed me!"

Create 2 branches called "stash-me" and "stash-fw" and switch to stash-me

Create a file stashme.txt and edit n paste the message "Not going to save here" [ IMP : Dont commit ]

Switch and Commit it to stash-fw branch.

Now switch to master and edit first.txt and add text "Stash sceneario 2" and commit as "Stash sceneario phase 2"

Switch to stash-fw and edit first.txt add message "No way back" [ IMP : Dont commit ] 

Now try to switch to main. Not able to switch ? Git wont let you do it.[ Conflict ?? Real use of stash ] 

Stash and move on.
